# ðŸ“š Book Collection API
My first Django REST API project with full CRUD operations. Built this to practice creating, reading, updating, and deleting data through REST endpoints.
Features books from some of my favorite authors like Stephen King and J.K. Rowling.

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.x
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- SQLite

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanjay-s22/Book-collection_DRF.git
   cd book-collection_DRF
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run migrations**
